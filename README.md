# AI-Image-Detector
A project focused on building a deep learning system that distinguishes between AI-generated and real human images. Utilizing a pretrained CoAtNet-2 model with advanced data augmentation, the system achieves robust accuracy through mixed precision training, label smoothing, and OneCycleLR scheduling.
